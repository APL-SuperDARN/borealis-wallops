Borealis Data Files
*******************

-----------
HDF5 Format
-----------

Borealis writes files into hdf5 format. Examples of how to use HDF5 files can
be found here for multiple languages: 
`HDF5 Examples <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/examples/>`_

To read the files in python, we recommend using PyTables or deepdish packages. 

Files are generated by Borealis in hdf5 format. The standard Borealis running mode generates hdf5 rawacf only. 
Dmap files can be created from the hdf5 rawacf or bfiq files using the `pydarn package <https://github.com/superdarn/pydarn>`_

------------------
Borealis filetypes
------------------

These are the Borealis filetypes produced by the radar software, from most processed to least processed.

* rawacf  
    The correlated data from the main and interferometer arrays. 

* bfiq  
    The beamformed iq data from both arrays. 

* antennas_iq  
    The iq data from every antenna.

* rawrf  
    The unfiltered, full receive bandwidth data from every antenna. 

For more information on the data files and the fields stored within them, check the data file information for the correct Borealis software version.
