Borealis Data Files
*******************

Borealis writes files into hdf5 format. Examples of how to use HDF5 files can
be found here for multiple languages: 
`HDF5 Examples <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/examples/>`_

To read the files in python, we recommend using PyTables or deepdish packages. 

The following data filetypes can be generated by Borealis in hdf5 format. The standard Borealis running mode generates hdf5 rawacf only. 

..  toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    antennas_iq
    bfiq
    rawacf

Additionally, debugging file formats such as rawrf (non-filtered high bandwidth data) can be generated upon request.
