Borealis Data Files
*******************

Borealis writes files into hdf5 format. This format can be read using commonly available libraries such as h5py or deepdish for python, as well as others for additional languages.

The following data filetypes can be generated by Borealis in hdf5 format. The standard Borealis running mode generates hdf5 rawacf only. 

..  toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    antennas_iq
    bfiq
    rawacf

For dmap files, please refer to rawacf dmap or iqdat dmap files produced via pydarn conversion from Borealis rawacf and Borealis bfiq files, respectively. The mapping of fields from the hdf5 format to the dmap format is included in the documentation above.


Additionally, debugging file formats such as rawrf (non-filtered high bandwidth data) can be generated upon request.
