cp_objects combine to create one RCP

NOTE: protoc is in /usr/local/lib/protobuf......../src/

use the line protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --python_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/driverpacket.proto
(I used $SRC_DIR=$DST_DIR).

# FILES CONTAINED HERE
1. experiment.py - An example of what a researcher would write.
2. currentctrlprog.py - a soft link to experiment.py for now (some sort of scheduler TBD)
3. cpobject.py - defines the cpobject. One object represents one frequency, one pulse sequence, one scan. 
    In this way all typical RCP's would be made with one cpobject. Multi-beam (imaging) or multi-freq (stereo)
    operations would require more than one control program. Other more complex functionality could be done with
    different methods of interfacing multiple cpobjects (different types of scans interleaved, etc.).
4. controlprog.py - combines one or more cpobjects into a control program. The experiment needs to create a
    ControlProg instance which initializes how many cpobjects you need.
5. radar_classes.py - Takes the controlprogram given and builds Scan, AveragingPeriod, and Sequence 
    objects which are used to run the radar.
6. runradar.py - Uses radar_classes objects to iterate through pulses, sequences, averaging periods, and 
    scans.
